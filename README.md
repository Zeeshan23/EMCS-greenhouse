Here we are developing a platform which can be useful for greenhouses. Here we are collecting data from sensor nodes and based on those data we are predecting a optimum condition inside the greenhouse using artificial neural networks. Then using actuators we are developing the optimum level inside the greenhouse.

# Building EMCS 

how to build

install dependencies with

npm install

and run platform with

npm run

# Neural Network based approach

The neural network model is trained to the dataset gained from our prototype greenhouse and as the initial step, only temperature controlling was considered for the neural network. This was trained to show the working actuators according to a given temperature.Here are performance results from matlab
